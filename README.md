# Word_Frequency

Frequency counter for block of words.

Takes a paragraph of words and counts , displays counts of words.

initial display would be very basic , might make it more presentable in future.

First personal project , got idea for this project from https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas.

Not sure what to do will figure something out .

Future design heavily inspired form https://wordfrequency.org/ .

Frontend only , uses html,css,js , no backen involved.
